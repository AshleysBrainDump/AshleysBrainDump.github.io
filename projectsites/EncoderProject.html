                This is one of my latest projects. <br>
                It's based on a cypher Invented in 8th Grade, <br>
                That I call "Quersummenschrift", or translated <br>
                from german, "The Quer Sum Cypher". <br>
                <br>
                <h3> The Quer Sum Cypher</h3>
                It works by setting up a classic <b>Caesar Cypher</b> <br>
                with all the relevant ASCII Character you might <br>
                need and the according numbers. <br>
                <br>
                Here is an example with the Word "Hello": <br>
                H -> 12 ; E -> 17 ; L -> 22 ; O -> 54 <br>
                H E L L O -> 12 17 22 22 54 <br>
                <br>
                This cypher is then further encrypted using "Quersummen" <br>
                <h4>"Quersummen", or "Sums of digits"</h4>
                Lets say you have a number like 666. You would get the <br> 
                "Quer Sum" of the number, by adding up each individual <br>
                digit. In case of 666, this would look as follows: <br>
                <br>
                666 = 6 + 6 + 6 = 18 -> i.c. The "Quer Sum" of 666 is 18 <br>
                <br>
                How would this translate to the cypher though? <br>
                Great question! Lets have a look: <br>
                Our rudementary Caesar cypher utilizes Numbers as its <br>
                assigned symbol. H -> 12, E -> 17 and so on. <br>
                What we'll do now, is take one of those numbers, for <br>
                example H -> 12, and think of all the possible <br>
                Quer Sums for the Number 12. For Example: <br>
                <br>
                5052 -> 5 + 0 + 5 + 2 = 12 <br>
                7113 -> 7 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12 <br>
                000000093 -> 7*0 + 9 + 3 = 12 <br>
                And so on... <br>
                <br>
                What we have done right now, is disected the number 12 <br>
                in a number of unique ways, that reverse engineered <br>
                still equal 12. If we were to do this with all the <br>
                letters, we would arrive at something like this: <br>
                <br>
                7113, 090611, 8530204, 770401111, 9009900900909 <br>
                <br>
                Which we could back decode into the numbers, and letters: <br>
                <br>
                7 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12 -> H <br>
                0 + 9 + 0 + 6 + 1 + 1 = 17 -> E <br>
                8 + 5 + 3 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 4 = 22 -> L <br>
                7 + 7 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 4*1 = 22 -> L <br>
                6*9 + 7*0 = 54 -> O <br>
                <br>
                Which gives us back the Message "HELLO"! <br>
                Now, its quite obvious how this cypher is better than <br>
                for example the Caesar cypher. The mere fact that we can <br>
                Present a Single letter in such an array of different <br>
                Sums practucally nullifies any statistics Algorithms <br>
                That look at the ammounts of different letters or <br>
                symbols in the text, and now a lot of Humans will <br>
                even think of something as obscure as a Sum of digits <br>
                when met with an array of random numbers (For further <br>
                confusion I recommend adding some Mathematical Operators <br>
                in between). However, it is still very tideous to encode<br>
                and decode messages in such a manner, especially <br>
                considering that if you want best encryption levels, <br>
                you should use at least two digit numbers as Sums. <br>
                <h3>The Encoder / Decoder</h3>
                Which leads me to my Program. The Quer Sum Encoder/Decoder <br>
                is a program that I made to make it easier to use the <br>
                Quersum Cypher. It has only a couple buttons, and the <br>
                layout is intuitive enough. <br>
                You can click the "Encode" button to convert your message <br>
                from Letters to Sums, and "Decode" to convert Sums back <br>
                into Letters. A .json file is used to store the initial <br>
                Caesar cypher, which you can modify or replace in a <br>
                separate Window, that you can access with the <br>
                "Edit Cypher" button. A Technical Limitation is the fact <br>
                that Spaces have to be replaced for underscores, because <br>
                the program is insensitive to spaces. But at least you <br>
                have the option to change the background by replacing the <br>
                background.png file in the folder, with another 600x500px <br>
                .png file with an identical name. <br>
                <br>
                <h3>Download Link</h3>
                I am leaving the .zip file with the whole Program here: <br>
                <br>
                <a href="../inconspiquos.zip" download>42069 Encoder/Decoder Program V1</a> <br>
                <br>
                All you have to do is extract the Folder and open the <br>
                .exe file inside. Leave the other stuff untouched. <br>
                You won't find anything of Interest, aside from the <br>
                changeable background.png and Icon.png.
