                <h4>A Space Invaders Clone</h4>   
                ------------------------------------------------------------ <br>
                Alrighty Right. <br>
                Space Invaders is one if not my most favourite Game. <br>
                It captivated me from the very moment I first installed it <br>
                on my calculator and the idea to recreate it came to me <br>
                quickly when i began thinking of making a project to learn <br>
                <b>Pygame</b>. 
                <br>
                <b> <i> DUM DUM DUUUUUUUM</i></b> <br>
                <br>
                All the sprites were drawn by me, and the fact that i kind <br>
                of stole the sprites from the original game by tracing <br>
                them is unrelated :D <br>
                I did add a couple of modification to the code though, <br>
                and I honestly think I made the gae so much more difficult! <br>
                Its honestly kind of surprising. <br>
                Maybe its just bad coding though. <br>

                <a href="../CloneWars.zip" download>Silly little Clone</a>
                Just extract the Folder and run the .exe. <br>
                All the other files are sprites and soundeffekts. <br>
                Oh and one file for the Highscore.
